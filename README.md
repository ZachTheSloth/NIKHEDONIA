# NIKHEDONIA

Written in Swift. A turn-based strategy game for iOS based on the board game 'Go.' The game has two players, and will feature multiple board layouts as well as online play. The goal of the game is to capture as much territory as possible by surrounding enemy structures with your own to destroy them.

The code is built on a Model-View-Controller strucutre, with the game manager, view, and board model all being separate. Keep this in mind when making any modifications.
